## What Is This? 
Get, Show, and Style a Class Roster via our API data

* Dynamically list content from an API data source
* Seperate the data from the design
* Use JS template literals for templating
* `fetch` a JSON endpoint data
* Apply foundations of a _headless CMS_

## API Endpoint
Use API endpoint for the _Collection_ provided in class.

## Why Does This Exist? 
I created a class roster to practice working on API'S and to gain a better understanding of how JS can heavily influence a project without having to incorporate a ton on HTML.
